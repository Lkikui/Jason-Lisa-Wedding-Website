            <p>We met sophomore year in high school in Mrs. Schwartz's English 2A class, where he sat right behind me. I thought I knew him from somewhere, so I initiated a conversation with him. It turns out that we were in the same dance group in our elementary school years, at Jensen's School for the Performing Arts. Then, I remembered that he was the only boy in the group who I always thought was cute and wanted to get to know, but was too shy to talk to. From that point on, we have been great friends.</p>
            <p>Our lives changed forever in the summer of 2009.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0">Out of the blue, Jason happened to be in my college town, Santa Cruz, and invited me to hang out at the beach with him and his best friend. This is when we realized that we had feelings for each other and held hands for the first time. He officially asked me out on July 1st, 2009.</p>

        <div class="hisSide paper">
            <p>My earliest recollections of Lisa are from my Sophomore year in high school, way back in the archaic year of 2005. I recall being seated near a skinny, dark-haired, awkward girl with perfect Anne Hathaway eyebrows. Her hair was smooth and shiny, with the blonde highlights that people thought were fashionable at the time. I, being the shy person that I was, was too afraid to talk her much back then (I thought she was way out of my league), but she remained a shining ray of light throughout the year. Little did I know what the future had in store.</p>
            <p>Fast forward 5 years.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0">I had finished up a nerdy session of Dungeons and Dragons in Boulder Creek and, knowing that Santa Cruz was nearby, decided to call Lisa for a quick visit. She accepted. I drove down, picked her up, took her to the beach, and the rest -- as they say -- is history.</p>

        <h4 class="secondaryHeading text-center capsFont">How It All Began</h4>
        <div class="howItBegan paper">
            <p>The year was 2016. By this point in time, Lisa and I had been dating for 6 years now and, as any self-respecting man, it was about time that I took the initiative to do the right thing and take the relationship to the next level. With the knowledge that we had a trip to Japan planned, I bought the ring a couple months in advance and waited for the trip to pop the question.</p>
            <p>Across the pond in the Land of the Rising Sun, I carried the ring everywhere we went together waiting for the right opportunity to present itself. After a week of not-quite-right situations, I finally had my chance. The two of us had been walking around Okayama by ourselves when we came across a river park . As we sat down to rest on a nearby bench, we found ourselves alone with nothing but the sound of the bubbling brook, the watchful gaze of a local guardian deity, and the warm hue of the setting sun beaming down on us.</p>
            <p>I knew that the time was right.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0">The rest of the proposal is a blur. I fumbled around for the ring box in my pocket and muttered some awkward proposal with a dry mouth and stubborn tongue, but I eventually got the answer I was hoping for: we were to be wed.</p>

        <h4 class="secondaryHeading text-center capsFont">How It Happened</h4>
        <div class="howItHappened paper">
            <p style="margin-bottom:0">We were visiting Japan to spend time with my ill grandmother as a family (including Jason) so he could meet her and see and experience Japan for the first time. We had a couple of days alone together to explore Okayama City, my mother's hometown and city of birth. After a day full of walking around to look at stores and eating great food, Jason said that he was tired and wanted to sit down. So we sat down on a bench in a small, serene park in the city which had trees, benches and a river flowing through, away from foot traffic and looked over by the park spirit guardian. He then nervously told me he had gotten me my birthday present and handed me a box. He patiently watched me open the box to reveal the ring. He then got down on one knee and said: "Boku to kekkon shi te" (Japanese for 'Will you marry me?'). The setting was so perfect since we had complete privacy, the park was calming and beautiful, and the spirit was watching over us as we became engaged. What I later found out was that the park is located just a few blocks from where the hospital I was born in used to be.</p>
